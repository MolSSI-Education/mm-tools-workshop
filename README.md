# MM Tools Starting Notebooks

This repository contains data and starting notebooks for the [MolSSI/MERCURY Molecular Mechanics Tools Workshop](https://education.molssi.org/mm-tools/).

You can run these notebooks on the cloud using [chemcompute](https://chemcompute.org/).


See the [instructions on the workshop set-up page](https://education.molssi.org/mm-tools/setup.html) to find out how to use these notebooks on your own computer or using chemcompute.
